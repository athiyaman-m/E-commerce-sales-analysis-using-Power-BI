Week-2 :

Step 1 : Data Analysis.

      1) Analysed the overview of the data file, it contains 9995 rows and 23 columns.
     
      2) It contains sales related parameter's such as customer details, product details, shipment details, number of sales, quantity and profit.

Step 2 : Data Preparation.

     1) Imported the data file (.xlsx formate) into Power BI through get data option.

     2)By using transform data option, checked the validity of the data's which includes error and empty values using "View" option in power query editor.

     3)Analysed and verified that all the data fields are not have null any values or incorrect formate data types. 

Step 3 : Data modeling.

     1) Since, the given xlxs file contains only one data sheet. So, data modeling is not available.
